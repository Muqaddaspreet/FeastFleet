## 🧩 Key Concepts Implemented

- **React Hooks**: `useState`, `useEffect` for managing component state and lifecycle.
- **Client-side Routing**: Smooth navigation with React Router (no full-page reloads).
- **Redux Toolkit**: Centralized store, slices (e.g., `CartSlice`), actions & selectors.
- **Optimizations**: Image optimization, caching, bundling, and differential builds.
- **Testing Strategy**:
  - Unit Testing
  - Integration Testing
  - End-to-End (E2E) Testing (planned)
